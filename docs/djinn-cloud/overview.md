# Overview

Djinn is going to use the [Open-core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-core_model) business model, which is the same that is used by:

- [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/)
- [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/)

The Community Edition is the open-source version that users can download and install in their own infrastructure, while the Enterprise Edition is a SaaS offering that is proprietary, it supports multi-tenancy creating a namespace per each tenant.
