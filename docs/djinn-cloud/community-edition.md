# Community Edition

This edition is open source and self-hosted, the user is able to install the application on any server that they want.

This is the list of features that are supported by the CE:

## Home grouping

In the cloud, the user is able to see all the devices and know which home each device belongs to.

## User access control

Once aboard is synchronized with the cloud, the agent from the board and the cloud get synchronized, which triggers a master-slave relationship where the master is the cloud.

All the user access, permissions, and roles get synchronized across the entire architecture, if a user is created on the board it automatically gets created in the cloud and the other boards.

## Device control

From the cloud, as long as the user has permissions, they would be able to control any device that they have access to.

## Custom Authentication Provider

Users would be able to configure and add a third-party provider for the OAuth authorization instead of the one that comes built in with the Djinn Cloud instance.
