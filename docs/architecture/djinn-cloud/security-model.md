# Security model
The cloud, as it's name state, is going to be publically available, and is more prone to attacks than the board that lives in a private network.

## Surface Area
In the cloud we are only going to expose the port that are required to run.

## Isolation
Since the cloud have more resources than a regular board, is going to use a more powerful Kubernetes implementation to handle the services.

In the **Enterprise Edition** is tenant belongs to a particular namespace, that way they are isolated one from another.

## Encryption
When the cloud instance is being created it automatically generate a secret key that belong to that instance and is used to encrypt all the data that is stored in the local sqlite database.

## Secure endpoints
All the exposed endpoints are required to use SSL, the gateway and the agent both use gRPC, which supports SSL/TLS for authentication, and the web client which exposes a GraphQL version as well run an HTTPS server, where the certificate is generated by the board.

Since in the cloud we have access to more [CA](https://www.ssl.com/faqs/what-is-a-certificate-authority/#:~:text=A%20certificate%20authority%20(CA)%2C,the%20issuance%20of%20electronic%20documents) the cloud could use either a SSL certificate generated by the instance or a third-party SSL certificate.
