![Djinn Board Architecture](/img/diagram/c4_diagram.png)

The architecture is composed of three components that talk to each other, and the IoT devices that are already registered in the network get attached to the board.

## User

The user is the human being that talks to the platform using [Clients](/docs/architecture/djinn-client/overview), these clients can talk to either the board directly, if they are in the same network (Locally), or remotely by talking to the cloud. The communication between the clients and the server (Board or Cloud) is encrypted and it uses OAuth, _and support for OpenID is considered in future development_

## Board

This is the main component of the architecture, it's distributed as a custom [System Image](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/system-image) that is built on top of [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/).

> For this implementation we are using a raspberry pi 4 as the board, but there isn't anything that would discourage the use of other boards or operating systems, as long as those systems enable the installation of the software stack that is described.

## Cloud

This is a server that is running in a publicly accessible network and enables users to access one or multiple homes from anywhere in the world with an internet connection.

> This component is not required unless the user wants to expose access to the devices from the internet.

## IoT Devices

These are devices that are already installed in the network or the house.

> Since the installation of each device depends on each vendor, this architecture does not handle the installation of any of the devices, only the control and notification of their states.
