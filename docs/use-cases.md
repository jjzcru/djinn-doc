# Use Case

This board is not target as a replacement of a home assistant like [Google Assistant](https://assistant.google.com), [Siri](https://www.apple.com/siri/) or [Alexa](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa), instead is taking a broader approach to be able to connect any type of devices and being able to control them from a centralized device, in network engineering this is called a [Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/38793).


If we try to broad the scope of the use cases toward something more general than just a home, this board is able to talk with different wave-bands, sending and receiving signals in a centralized fashion, this kind of behaviour is what is called a [Gateway](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5308112) in the context of WSN.

Devices like Google Assistant, Siri or Alexa, are one type of WSN which uses propetary protocols and integration but they are still WSN gateway none the less, they are built to support a seamless integration in a particular ecosystem, the approach of this project is to enable manufacturers or developers to write their own plugins and integrate them in the gateway without the need to conform to a particular ecosystem.

Now with this change in perspective this are some of the use cases we can achieve with WSN using the board.

## House Control

The mainstream use for this board is to be able to add regular IoT devices like plugs, lights, locks or sprinkles, and control them from either an app, a desktop or from a browser.

There are ecosystem that use hubs that serve as a centralized structure to controls devices like the [IKEA's TRÃ…DFRI](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/tradfri-gateway-white-00337813/) and [Phillips Hue Bridge](https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-bridge/046677458478). 

This hubs exposes API that enable developers to build integration that talks with those hubs and expand the possibility to control them, as long as there is a Plug-in that know how to interact and registered with this ecosystem a developer has a freedom to build whatever they want on top of the platform and as a user is just a matter of installing the plugin and configure it.  

## Environmental Monitoring
This board is build to be as agnostic as possible, it only know that it needs to have an internet connection that could be achieve either by an ethernet cable or by a wifi network, there is nothing that limit the device to only use devices that are manufactured by household companies.

As a user you can buy IoT devices that support are supported by the board (Z-wave, Zigbee, Wifi, Bluetooth) and with a plugin you could integrate that device into the platform.

This could help for monitoring wildlife and natural parks with sensors, sense the temperature or humidity in agriculture.

> For this kind of environment the case for the board would be different, it would required to have a case with an [IP rating](https://lumascape.com/ip-ratings) of at least 65 and an [IK rating](https://lumascape.com/ik-ratings#:~:text=IK%20Ratings%20are%20an%20international,equipment%20against%20external%20mechanical%20impacts.) that would depend of each particular use case.

## Health & Medicine
The platform have a component called `Djinn Cloud CE` that enables to join multiple boards to centralized components, if you are in a hospital you could have different boards in each wing and each of this connected to a `Djinn Cloud` instance running on-promise.

As a Hospital administrator you don't even need to worry about connecting to the internet and everything could be self-hosted.

For small clinics you could have a single board in the clinic to control the devices and you link the board to a `Djinn Cloud EE` instance and the user would be able to control and monitor the clinic dynamically.

Regarding the devices, it would be up to the manufacturer of the devices to have a supported wireless protocol and the plugin implementator to know how it works, but there isn't any restriction that would discourage the usage of health devices.

## Manufacturing
The concept of IIoT, (Industrial Internet of Things), is a way to add digital transformation into manufacturing. As long as a device offers control and communicate their state in a understandable, open protocol, there is nothing that limits what an IoT device can do.

In the article [IoT in Manufacturing: The Ultimate Guide](https://www.scnsoft.com/blog/iot-in-manufacturing) describe the adoption of IIoT in manufacturing and the benefits that it provides.

There is a consortiums dedicated to move forward the adoption of IoT in Manufacturing:
- [Industrial Internet of Things Consortium (IIC)](https://www.iiconsortium.org/)
- [OpenFog Consortium](https://opcfoundation.org/markets-collaboration/openfog/)

There are already archictures like [OPC-UA](https://opcfoundation.org/about/opc-technologies/opc-ua/) which defines an specification on how this could be implemented, there isn't any constraint on how implementation must be executed since they provide an abstraction of how the different pieces fit together.

One way to integrate this with the board would be to implement the specification and then use a hub that exposes the api and the board connect to the hub or the other way would be to make the board to behave as a Gateway Framework.

The proposed Djinn Board architecture is actually based in the Type II Gateway proposed by the book [Demystifying Internet of Things Security](https://library.oapen.org/handle/20.500.12657/22840).
